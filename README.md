## 🔥 Overview

This repository contains my **daily Python coding challenge solutions**, solved to strengthen:

- Algorithmic thinking  
- Problem-solving skills  
- Clean and readable Python code  
- Interview readiness through consistent practice  

The problems come from **FreeCodeCamp**, curated challenge lists, and self-designed exercises.  
Each file represents **one problem solved on a specific day**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Build a strong, consistent coding habit  
- Create a visible GitHub activity streak  
- Document progress in Python and algorithms  
- Maintain a growing portfolio of challenge solutions  

---

## 📁 Repository Structure (Simple & Recruiter-Friendly)

All solutions are stored as **individual Python files**, making this repo extremely easy to browse:

```
vowel_balance.py
base_check.py
reverse_string.py
array_chunk.py
fibonacci.py
...
```

✔ No complex folder structure  
✔ Each solution is self-contained  
---

## 🧠 What Each File Includes

- Full problem description  
- My initial and optimized solutions  
- Clean, commented Python code  
- Example inputs and outputs  
- Multiple approaches when needed  

This makes each solution file easy to understand independently.

## 🏆 My Coding Journey

I began solving daily challenges on **August 11, 2025**, to improve logical reasoning and coding discipline.  
This repository represents that journey — one problem at a time.

Although many files were uploaded later, the commit history is aligned to the actual days I solved them.

---

## 🛠 Running Any Solution

Use Python 3:

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

Example:

```bash
python3 vowel_balance.py
```

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add more challenge solutions regularly  
- Improve explanations inside each solution  
- Add optional unit tests for selected algorithms  
- Include time & space complexity more consistently
